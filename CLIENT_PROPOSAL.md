- Branded email templates for confirmations, reschedules, cancellations, payments
- Secure login and account handling (including password setup/reset)

Each milestone is deployed to staging first for your review and sign‑off, then promoted to production.

A milestone is accepted when:
- The agreed features work on staging without critical issues

- Emails render correctly and show accurate details
- You provide written approval (email/PM tool)

### 9) Handover
At project close we will provide:
- Access to the code repository

### 11) Pricing & Payment Terms
- Fixed fee per milestone or time & materials (to be agreed)

- Your content, brand, and data remain yours.

### 13) Data Protection
- You are the data controller for your customer data. Supabase and Resend are processors.
- We will configure reasonable security measures and follow best practices.

### 14) Change Requests
- If you request new features outside this proposal, we’ll provide an estimate and adjust the timeline/fees once approved.

### 15) Assumptions
- You will provide timely feedback and approvals.
- Existing accounts/services (Supabase, Resend, hosting) are in good standing.
- Hosting and third‑party service costs are your responsibility.

### 16) Next Steps
