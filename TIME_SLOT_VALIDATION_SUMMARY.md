# Time Slot Validation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Fixed time slot validation issues to prevent past slots from being displayed or booked, with proper buffer time handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoints Updated

#### `/api/time-slots/availability/route.ts`
- Added filtering for past time slots with 30-minute buffer
- Prevents fetching slots for past dates
- Filters today's slots to only show those starting after current time + 30 minutes

#### `/api/admin/time-slots/route.ts`
- Added optional `excludePast=true` query parameter for filtering past slots
- Admins can see all slots by default, but can filter if needed

#### `/api/bookings/[id]/available-slots/route.ts`
- Updated to respect 24-hour minimum notice for rescheduling
- Filters out past time slots when fetching available slots

### 2. Frontend Components Updated

#### `TimeSlotSelection.tsx`
- Added `isSlotInPast()` function with 30-minute buffer
- Past slots are displayed as disabled with "Expired" label
- Booked slots show "Booked" label
- Added notice about 30-minute booking requirement
- Improved time formatting with error handling

#### Admin Components
- `TimeSlot.tsx` already had proper past slot handling
- `DayCard.tsx` uses `isSlotPast()` with 5-minute buffer for admin view

### 3. New Utility Module

#### `/lib/utils/time-validation.ts`
Created centralized time validation utilities:
- `isTimeSlotPast()` - Check if slot is in the past with buffer
- `getMinimumBookableTime()` - Get minimum bookable time (now + buffer)
- `getPastSlotFilter()` - Generate SQL-friendly filters
- `BOOKING_BUFFER_MINUTES` constant (30 minutes)

## Display States

### Customer View
- **Past Unbooked**: Disabled, shows "Expired"
- **Past Booked**: Disabled, shows "Expired"
- **Future Available**: Enabled, shows end time
- **Future Booked**: Disabled, shows "Booked"

### Admin View
- **Past Slots**: Slightly transparent, marked "Past"
- **All slots visible** for historical reference
- Can optionally filter past slots with query parameter

## Business Rules Implemented

1. **30-minute buffer**: Customers cannot book slots starting within 30 minutes
2. **No past bookings**: Cannot book or select slots in the past
3. **24-hour rescheduling**: Minimum 24 hours notice for rescheduling
4. **Today's slots**: Only show slots after current time + buffer
5. **Future dates**: Show all slots regardless of time

## Testing

Created `test-time-slot-validation.js` to verify:
- Past dates are rejected (400 error)
- Today's slots are filtered correctly
- Tomorrow's slots show all times
- API responses follow expected format

## Next Steps

1. Add more time slots to the database for thorough testing
2. Consider adding timezone support if serving multiple regions
3. Add unit tests for the time validation utilities
4. Monitor for edge cases around midnight transitions
